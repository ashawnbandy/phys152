In this lab we measured the electrical properties of two circuits.  The first circuit contained a DC power supply and two resistors in series.  We measured the voltage across each resistor as well as the current between the power supply and each resistor.  The second circuit contained  a DC power supply and two resistors in series.  We measured current and used the known values of the resistors to calculate the voltage in the nested circuit loops.  The objective for testing each circuit was to demonstrate the conservation of energy in electrical circuits by comparing measurements and estimations.  In the case of the both circuits, we could not demonstrate the conservation of energy although the data would warrant further investigation and experimentation.  

Although the uncertainty factors were given for the equipment I do not suspect that our equipment was faulty and so our data probably cannot be explained by this kind of error.  It is possible that that environmental electrical and magnetic fields interfered with the circuitry.  Again, given the size of our errors I suspect this would only account for some of the variance in our data.  There was an unusual amount of confusion about the procedure for Circuit \#2 which is a likely source of error.
