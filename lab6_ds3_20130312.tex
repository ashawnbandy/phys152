\subsection{DATA TABLE \#3}
	\begin{enumerate}[A.]
		\item In circuit 1, is energy conserved around the loop of the circuit? \\
		\begin{enumerate}[1.]
			\item $[\Delta V_1 \pm uncertainty] + [\Delta V_2 \pm uncertainty] = 8.7791 \pm 0.088 V$ 
			
			\item Does the calculated [sum $\pm$ uncertainty] above overlap with the measured value $[\Delta V_1 \pm uncertainty]$?\\
			
			No, they do not overlap.  The gap between the uncertainty intervals is about 0.15 volts.\\
			
			If not, by what percentage does it differ?\\
			
			The differ by about \%1.0074.
			
			\item Based on your data, is energy conserved around the loop of the circuit?  State your reasoning below.\\
			
			Based on the data and given that the measurements were accurate and the given uncertainty intervals correct, then no I would not say energy is conserved around the loop of the circuit.  However, if this were a first experiment in this area then I would suggest that our data indicates that further experiments should be conducted by more controlled and rigorous methods.  I would also leave open the possibility that there is a physical explanation beyond measurement or calculation error as well.\\
