\subsection{DATA SHEET \#6}
	\begin{enumerate}[A.]
		\item In circuit 2, is energy conserved around the various closed loops of the circuit?  There are three possible closed loops in this circuit, shown in the diagram (omitted from this report) as dashed lines simply labeled as 1, 2, 3.  Show explicitly, for each of these loops, using the appropriate symbols in one line and the same equation in the second line that the sum of the potential differences around each loop is zero.  If your sums are not zero, state why you think they do not.\\ 
		
	Loop 3: $0 + I_1 * R_1 + 0 =  40.4 V$\\
	Loop 2: $0 + I_2 * R_2 + 0 = 12.35 V$\\
	Loop1: $Measured current * Equivalent Resistor = 25V$\\
	
	Sum of loops 40.4 - 12.35 - 25 = 3.05\\
	
	The sum of our loops does not equal 0 which suggests either there was an error in how we carried out the procedure or in our measurements or there is a an actual physical phenomenon that was not controlled for in this experiment.
