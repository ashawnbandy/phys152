We began by assembling the circuit of three resistors and two power supplies as outlined in the lab procedure.  Both negative terminals of the power supplies were connected to a resistor ($R_2$) that was measured at 10.85 $\Omega$.  The positive terminal of power supply A connected to $R_1$ which measured 4.66 $\Omega$.  The positive terminal of power supply B connected to $R_3$ that was measured at 1.54 $\Omega$.  The unconnected sides of $R_1$ and $R_3$ were connected to the unconnected end of $R_2$.  When the power supplies were switched on, we measured the voltage across each resistor (see Data Sheet \#1 for measurements).  Using Ohm's law, we calculated the values of the current for each of the three segments of the circuit.  Finally we measured the current directly by placing the leads of the Ammeter inline between each of the two positive terminals of the batteries and the negative terminals with their respective resistors.
