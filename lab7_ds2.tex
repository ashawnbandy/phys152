\subsection{DATA SHEET \#2}
	\item Use both of Kirchoff's rules to write at least 3 equations that can be solved for the three currents.  Draw in your assumed currents for each of the resistors.  Three CW loops have been provided for this circuit.  There are two branch points for the currents.\\
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item For one of the branch points, write an equation, using Kirchoff's current rule, which describes the currents going into and out of the branch point.  Label the currents into the point as positive and out of the point as negative.\\
		
		$I_2 - (I_1 + I_3) = 0$ \\
		
		\item For the three closed loops drawn on the circuit, use the voltage rule to construct three equations involving the potential changes around each loop.  \
		
		$\Delta V_{A} +  \Delta V_{B} + \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2$ = 0\\
		$\Delta V_{A}  + \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2$ = 0\\
		$\Delta V_{B}  + \Delta V_3 + \Delta V_2$ = 0\\
