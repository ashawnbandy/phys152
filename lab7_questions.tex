\begin{enumerate}[1.] %TODO
	\item Were your initial assumptions for directions of current completely correct? \\
	
	Yes, at least at the point when we came to an understanding of where the measurements for current should be taken.
	
	\item For Part E's data above, did the two different meter settings for the current measurements make any difference in the measured currents?  Why or why not?
	
	At least at the voltage from our power supplies they made an incredible amount of difference.  For example, at the 200 mA setting, the measurements for $I_1$ and $I_3$ were zero which is clearly not precise enough to use for further calculations or comparisons to other measurements.
